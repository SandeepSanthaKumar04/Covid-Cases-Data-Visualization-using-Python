# Covid-Cases-Data-Visualization-using-Python
This project creates an interactive COVID-19 dashboard using Python. Data on cases across five Indian states is stored in CSV files and processed with pandas. Visualizations, including pie charts, bar graphs, and line charts, are generated with matplotlib. A tkinter-based UI provides user login and access to these visualizations.
